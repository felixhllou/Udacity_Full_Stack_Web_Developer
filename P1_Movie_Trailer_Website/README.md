# Movie Trailer Website: Fresh Tomatoes

Project 1 of Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

### About

This repository provides a script to generate a website of movie trailers based on the data loaded in a CSV file.

`media.py` defines a class entailing movie title, poster, trailer, and release year. 

`entertainment_center.py` fetches the movies' data from the CSV file, and runs a function called `open_movies_page` from the `fresh_tomatoes.py` module that creates an HTML file which will display all of the fetched movies.

### Requirements

Dependencies to run the code: Python 2.7 or newer version

### Instructions

To run the script, clone the repository and run `entertainment_center.py`. A compiled page can be viewed by opening `fresh_tomatoes.html` with a browser.
